In this post I will do the same only this time the goal is to create a AKS cluster in Azure and what changes needed from the scripts used to provision a GKE cluster.

Later the monoliths where replaced by microservices, nanoservice or functions. No matter what you are writing or calling it you will eventually need some servers to run it on.
Yes even serverless at some point require servers, it&amp;rsquo;s just someone else&amp;rsquo;s server.
As a developer at heart I strive to automate as much as possible through code, even the server.</description></item><item><title>Welcome to 418.cloud</title><link>http://418.cloud/posts/2021/06/welcome-to-418.cloud/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 16:26:21 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://418.cloud/posts/2021/06/welcome-to-418.cloud/</guid><description>After far too much time I have finally taken the time to add some content to one of the domains I control, yes there are more without any content ;)
The domain 418.cloud is inspired by the HTTP status 418 I'm a teapot. I&amp;rsquo;m a coffee man myself, but who wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want some tea in the clouds.
Hopefully I will someday add some more posts with trivial dev/ops HOWTOs that you can find better explained at some other site, links might be included.</description></item></channel></rss>
