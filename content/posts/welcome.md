After far too much time I have finally taken the time to add some content to one of the domains I control, yes there are more without any content ;)

The domain 418.cloud is inspired by the HTTP status ```418 I'm a teapot```. I'm a coffee man myself, but who wouldn't want some tea in the clouds.

Hopefully I will someday add some more posts with trivial dev/ops HOWTOs that you can find better explained at some other site, links might be included.
