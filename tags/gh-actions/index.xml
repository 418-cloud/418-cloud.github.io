In this post I will do the same only this time the goal is to create a AKS cluster in Azure and what changes needed from the scripts used to provision a GKE cluster.

Later the monoliths where replaced by microservices, nanoservice or functions. No matter what you are writing or calling it you will eventually need some servers to run it on.
Yes even serverless at some point require servers, it&amp;rsquo;s just someone else&amp;rsquo;s server.
As a developer at heart I strive to automate as much as possible through code, even the server.</description></item></channel></rss>
